> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Experimental Project**: This is a work-in-progress implementation of the RFB protocol. Several critical encodings and features are still under development. Contributions are welcome!

> ü§ñ **AI-Assisted Development**: This project was developed with the assistance of **GitHub Copilot**, **Anthropic Claude 3.5**, and **Visual Studio 2026**, demonstrating the potential of AI-powered development tools in creating complex protocol implementations.

## Overview

RfbTest is an experimental VNC (Virtual Network Computing) server/client implementation that explores various framebuffer encoding techniques for efficient remote desktop streaming. The project leverages DirectX for screen capture and implements multiple RFB protocol encodings.

## Features

### ‚úÖ Implemented Encodings

- **Raw Encoding**: Basic uncompressed pixel data transfer
- **CopyRect Encoding**: Highly efficient region duplication (99.99% compression for moved content)
- **RRE (Rise-and-Run-length Encoding)**: Optimized for simple UI with solid color regions (90-99% compression)
- **Hextile Encoding**: Tile-based encoding for general desktop content (50-80% compression)

### üöß Missing Critical Implementations (Help Needed!)

We're actively seeking contributions for the following high-priority features:

#### Priority 1: ZRLE Encoding ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Why it matters**: Best compression ratio, widely supported by modern VNC clients
- **Benefits**: 80-95% compression with zlib + RLE combination
- **Ideal for**: Bandwidth-constrained scenarios, remote work environments

#### Priority 2: Tight Encoding ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Why it matters**: Industry standard for image optimization (TightVNC)
- **Benefits**: JPEG + Zlib combination, excellent for photo/video content
- **Ideal for**: Multimedia applications, complex graphics

#### Priority 3: Cursor Pseudo-encoding ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Why it matters**: Significantly reduces network traffic for cursor movements
- **Benefits**: Client-side cursor rendering, smoother user experience
- **Ideal for**: Low-latency interactions, reducing server load

### üîß Core Components

- **RfbServer**: Main server implementation handling client connections
- **RfbClient**: Client connection management and protocol negotiation
- **RfbEncoder**: Base encoder interface and encoding strategy
- **RfbLogger**: Diagnostic logging for protocol debugging
- **WindowsInputHandler**: Input event processing for remote control

### üìö Documentation

- Comprehensive encoding guide in `Docs/EncodingGuide.md` (Korean)
- Working examples for RRE and CopyRect encodings
- Performance benchmarks and encoding selection strategies

## Technology Stack

- **.NET 8.0** (Windows)
- **SharpDX**: DirectX 11 screen capture
- **System.Drawing.Common**: Image processing

## Encoding Performance Comparison

| Encoding | Compression | Speed | Best Use Case |
|----------|-------------|-------|---------------|
| **CopyRect** | 99.99% | Very Fast | Window dragging, scrolling |
| **RRE** | 90-99% | Fast | Simple UI, dialog boxes |
| **Hextile** | 50-80% | Medium | General desktop content |
| **Raw** | 0% | Very Fast | Fallback, incompressible content |
| **ZRLE** ‚ö†Ô∏è | 80-95% | Medium | ‚ùå Not yet implemented |
| **Tight** ‚ö†Ô∏è | 70-90% | Medium | ‚ùå Not yet implemented |
